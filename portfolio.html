<h3>About my game</h3>
<p>
    My scratch game, Fighter, is about you in a spaceship fighting agaisnt enemy<br>
    ships that will keep coming until you died. My scoring system is the lives count<br>
    and enemy ships killed. The randomness is where the enemy ship come from, its<br>
    can come from the left or right at anytime. The game get difficult by the more<br>
    enemy you killed the faster they spawn. The game end when you died 3 times.
</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
    I created this game because it was once my favorite childhood game. The 2<br>
    most crucial points that leaded to the success of my game was able to code<br>
    the enemy random spawn and the ablitity to allow your shots follow the plane.<br>
    2 main obstacle as I made this game was the timing of the enemy spawn and the<br>
    player lives count when you get hit. If I had more time I would definitely added<br>
    a boss fight to make it a little harder.
</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>
    This is an algorithm due to how you need to press a certain key for the sprite<br>
    to move and when get hit you will lose lives count. As you lose lives point<br>
    your sprite will become a little pixaleted to show that you just lost a life.
