<h3>About my game</h3>
<p>
    My scratch game, Fighter, is about you in a spaceship fighting agaisnt enemy<br>
    ships that will keep coming until you died. My scoring system is the lives count<br>
    and enemy ships killed. The randomness is where the enemy ship come from, its<br>
    can come from the left or right at anytime. The game get difficult by the more<br>
    enemy you killed the faster they spawn. The game end when you died 3 times.
</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
    I created this game because it was once my favorite childhood game. The 2<br>
    most crucial points that leaded to the success of my game was able to code<br>
    the enemy random spawn and the ablitity to allow your shots follow the plane.<br>
    2 main obstacle as I made this game was the timing of the enemy spawn and the<br>
    player lives count when you get hit. If I had more time I would definitely added<br>
    a boss fight to make it a little harder.
</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>
    This is an algorithm due to how you need to press a certain key for the sprite<br>
    to move and when get hit you will lose lives count. As you lose lives point<br>
    your sprite will become a little pixaleted to show that you just lost a life.

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>To create this story we first have to think of a theme that we have to focus on<br>
and plan out all the possible ending for it to make sense to the reader. After<br>
planning all the steps and ending out we started to code our program and as we code<br>
it we have to read the story over and over to make sure it grammatically correct.<br>
In addition, we had to play the story over and over to make sure there are no <br>
bugs otherwise the game won't be as smooth. The most difficult obstacle we went<br>
through is picking which ending to make the story good and entertaining for readers<br>
We resolved this by asking peers for their opinion on which ending sound better.<br></p>
<h3>Procedural Abstraction</h3>
<p> Organizing scenes of my story into functions is a form of procedural abstraction<br>
because I as the creator of this story know all the possible endings and all the<br>
path that will take me to the ending that I want but as the readers read they<br>
can pick whatever path they want and result in the same ending as I ended up with.<br>
The advantages of having abstracting into my function is to give it some randomness.<br>
In addition, all people have different ways of viewing something so giving people<br>
the ability to chose their own path is more fun and entertaining for them.</p>
<h3>The Story I Liked</h3>
<p>Of all the story I read in the past I particularly liked the story called<br>
"Batman Trilogy" and I liked this story because the plot was unique and the content<br>
was also great.</p>
